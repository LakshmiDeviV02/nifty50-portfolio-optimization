# 📈 AI-Powered Real-Time Stock Portfolio Optimization for NIFTY50
In the face of rapid market fluctuations and complex data environments, this project delivers an intelligent investment platform tailored for the Indian stock market. Leveraging real-time and historical data from Yahoo Finance, enriched with technical indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands, the system uses an XGBoost model for short-term Nifty50 stock prediction. Portfolio optimization is performed using the Markowitz Efficient Frontier, considering user-specific risk tolerance, expected returns, and key ratios like Sharpe and Sortino. The platform is implemented via a Flask web app with secure login (including Google OAuth), interactive dashboards, and real-time WhatsApp alerts using Twilio.
